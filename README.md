# Mike_Projects
Designing and implement a system in C or C++, that will act as a simulation engine to compare the impact of different vaccine distribution strategies on the spread of a disease. 
Specifically, you will be examining how prioritizing vaccine distribution across areas using closeness centrality and degree centrality compare against each other and random and equal distribution strategies. 
The results of these experiments should be provided to the user at the end in an easy to read format.
